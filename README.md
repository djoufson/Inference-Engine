# **Package presentation**
Here are the main classes of this package explained with encapsulated methods

## **`Fact`**

A fact is an entity described by two properties, that implements the `IFact` interface

| Property                 | Description                   |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| string **Name** { get; } | The name of the fact          |
| bool **Value** { get; }  | The boolean value of the fact |

To make a new Fact, there is a factory class provided with serveral manners of making new facts

## **`FactFactory`**

With this class, there are two static methods availables to make new facts

| Method Signature | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | 
| Fact MakeFact(string name, bool value); | Takes the **name** and the **value** as parameters. Note that the name should not contain any of the special characters listed here =~`!@#$%^&\*()-+={}[]|/:;\"'<>,.? |
| Fact MakeFact(string factFormat); | Takes only one string parameter, that represents a formatted string matching some required pattern. |

## Example
*Note: The following examples emulate a cards game*

Here are some examples of how to use the FacfFactory class

``` cSharp
using static InferenceEngine.Factories.FactFactory;

var myFirstFact = MakeFact("IsRed", true); // Explicit arguments
var mySecondFact = MakeFact("IsJoker=false"); // Formated string

// For more safety, you should wrap the MakeFact that uses the formated string into a try - catch statement
```

Then you can use those facts.

## **`Rule`**
A **rule** is basically an expression like ***If (some conditionnal facts) Then (A new fact)***

The list of facts to satisfy is called **Premises**, while the inferred fact is the **Conclusion**

To illustrate this expression, a Rule object is provided the following properties

| Property                            | Description                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| string Name { get; set; }           | The name of the rule                                                                         |
| List\<IFact\> Premises { get; set;} | The list that contains all the facts to satisfy in order to deduce a new fact from this rule |
| IFact Conclusion { get; set; }      | The conclusion to assert if every of the premises are satisfied                              |

## **`RuleFactory`**
To create new Rules, this static class is provided to the users of the package.
With this class, there are actually two ways of creating a rule, all of them through easy API.

| Method SSignature                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rule MakeRule(Rule rule, string ruleName = "")                                    | This method takes two arguments, a **rule** to copy, and an optional **ruleName** to override the provided one. It returns a copy of the provided rule in a new variable                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `Rule` MakeRule(string ruleName, `IFact` conclusion, `params` `IFact`[] premises) | That method takes basically three arguments or more. The two firstones are respectively the **ruleName** we want to apply to the rule, and the **conclusion** we want to deduce if premises are satisfied. Also, the remaining **params** are an array of `IFacts` that will represents the premisses of the rules. They can be passed to the method each separated by commas. |

## Example
We will continue the code written for the previous example
``` cSharp
using static InferenceEngine.Factories.FactFactory;
using static InferenceEngine.Factories.RuleFactory;

var myFirstFact = MakeFact("IsRed", true); // Explicit arguments
var mySecondFact = MakeFact("IsJoker=true"); // Formated string

var conclusion = MakeFact("IsRedJoker", true);
// For more safety, you should wrap the MakeFact that uses the formated string into a try - catch statement

// We now create a rule using the second method provided by the API
var myRule = MakeRule("Rule1", conclusion, myFirstFact, mySecondFact);
// So IF (IsRed AND IsJoker) THEN IsRedJoker
```

## **`FactsBase`** & **`RulesBase`**
In order to store the known Facts and Rules, we provide some repositories classes to encapsulate operations like Adding a new Fact, removing one, Adding a range an so on. Those two classes inherit from a base generic **DataBase** with the following capabilities

The concrete implementations get several constructors to ensure that the usage is easy

| Method                                        | Description                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| void Clear()                                  | That remove all known statement.                                                                                                            |
| void AddData(T newData)                       | `T` represents here either a Rule or a Fact. This method adds the new instance to the appropriate repository                                |
| void AddRangeDatas(IEnumerable\<T\> newDatas) | Same to thr previous one, `T` represents a Rule or a Fact. This method adds a range of items of the same type in the appropriate repository |
| T SearchData(string dataName)                 | This method retrieves an instance of data with the provided name in the appropriat repository                                               |

## **`Engine`**
Finally, the core part of this package, is the Engine class that Enables to solve a certain collection of rules, given a collection of facts. 

*note: This class is to be instantiated, and does not contain any static member*

Here is the methods related to this class

**The Constructor**
``` cSharp
public Engine(FactsBase factsBase, RulesBase rulesBase)
{ 
  //... Instantiates an Engine with a provided FactsBase and RulesBase
}
```

| Method                      | Description                                                                            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IEnumerable<IFact> Solve(); | Solves the problem by inferring every new fact possible, and returns the list of facts |
| List<Fact> GetFacts();      | Gets the existing facts                                                                |
| string PrintFacts();        | Prints the current facts to the console                                                |

## Example

``` cSharp
using static InferenceEngine.Factories.FactFactory;
using static InferenceEngine.Factories.RuleFactory;

var myFirstFact = MakeFact("IsRed", true); // Explicit arguments
var mySecondFact = MakeFact("IsJoker=true"); // Formated string

var conclusion = MakeFact("IsRedJoker", true);
// For more safety, you should wrap the MakeFact that uses the formated string into a try - catch statement

// We now create a rule using the second method provided by the API
var myRule = MakeRule("Rule1", conclusion, myFirstFact, mySecondFact);

// The fact base is initialized with just two facts
var factBase = new FactsBase(new[] {myFirstFact, mySecondFact});

var ruleBase = new RulesBase();

// We add the rule defined higher in the code
ruleBase.AddRule(myRule);

// We create the engine with the factBase and ruleBase (That contains only one rules)
var engine = new Engine(factBase, ruleBase);

// We print the existing facts before solving
Console.WriteLine("======== BEFORE ========");
Console.WriteLine(engine.PrintFacts());

engine.Solve();

// After solving the problem, we print the Facts. Logically, we can deduce the new fact according to the only rule we have, because all of its premises are true.

Console.WriteLine("======== AFTER ========");
Console.WriteLine(engine.PrintFacts());
```

*Output :*
```
======== BEFORE ========
IsRed | True
IsJoker | True

======== AFTER ========
IsRed | True
IsJoker | True
IsRedJoker | True
```
